The HR Dashboard is a Power BI visualization I created following a video on youtube. IT was my very first Power BI visualization created. After this one, I have gone on to create more visualizations using Power BI, and more than anything, visualization with Power BI is one thing I really enjoy. Just incase you do not have Power BI installed on your device, I have included snap shots of each page of the visualization, with the first page being the Home Page, followed by Demographics, Stats, Severance, Details and Recommendation.
